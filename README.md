## Research Overview
This repository showcases an in-depth qualitative research study examining the intersection of experiential learning, professional development, and identity formation in practice-based professional learning. Through systematic analysis of 40 hours of interview data, this study reveals key insights into how professionals develop expertise through various learning modalities including apprenticeship, cognitive apprenticeship, and autonomous learning.

## Thematic Analysis Framework

### Evolution of Analysis
The thematic framework evolved through careful analysis of interview data, as visualized in these key artifacts:

1. **Original Inspiration**  
![Original Piano Frame](piano-frame.jpg)
*Initial conceptual framework inspiration*

2. **Thematic Analysis Framework**  
![Thematic Analysis Framework](thematic-analysis.png)
*Final thematic framework showing the integration of identified themes and relationships*

## Qualitative Data Analysis Process

### Raw Data Analysis
The complete coding structure is available in two detailed grid views:
- [Major Themes Grid](major-themes-grid.csv) - Primary thematic categories and their relationships
- [Sub-Themes Grid](sub-themes-grid.csv) - Detailed breakdown of subthemes and their connections

### Primary Themes

#### 1. Means of Transitioning
- Master-Apprentice Model
- Autonomous transition
- Experiential Learning
- Cognitive Apprenticeship
- Traditional Apprenticeship

#### 2. Development Aspects
- Teaching Style Development
- Professional Confidence
- Identity Formation
- Reflective Practice

#### 3. Professional Growth
- Formal Learning Integration
- Challenge Navigation
- Resource Utilization
- Community Support

## Research Methodology

### Data Collection & Analysis Tools
- NVivo Qualitative Data Analysis Software
- Systematic coding framework development
- Iterative theme refinement process

### Analysis Workflow
1. **Initial Coding**
   - Raw interview transcription
   - Open coding in NVivo
   - Initial theme identification

2. **Theme Development**
   - Pattern identification
   - Category refinement
   - Framework development

3. **Final Analysis**
   - Theme consolidation
   - Relationship mapping
   - Visual framework creation
